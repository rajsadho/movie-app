# MovieApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2. It consumes [this Movie API](https://dcitmovieapi.herokuapp.com/) to produce a Master-Detail view of Movies and Movie details, as well as user comments for movies. At this time, responsiveness is not included in the application.

## Development server
